    but the Push is expired or deleted.

    .NOTES
    Including this endpoint for completeness - however it is generally unnecessary.
    The only thing this endpoint does is return a different value depending if "Use 1-click retrieval step"
    was selected when the Push was created.  Since both the 1-click and the direct links are available
    regardless if that option is selected, the links are calculable and both are included by default in a
    [PasswordPush] object.

    As it returns false if a Push URL token is not valid you can use it to test if a Push exists without
    burning a view.
