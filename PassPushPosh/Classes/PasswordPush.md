# Class: [PasswordPush]

## SUMMARY

Represents a Push with all metadata including Payload (password) value

## DESCRIPTION

Represents a Push on the Password Pusher server.  Depending on the source of data, may include payload (secret string) value.
`[PasswordPush]` objects are generated by any cmdlet that returns full data on a push.  Currently `New-Push`, `Get-Push`, `Remove-Push`, and `Get-Dashboard` return
`[PasswordPush]` objects and `Remove-Push` accepts them for input.
