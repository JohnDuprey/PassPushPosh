# PassPushPosh

*PassPushPosh* is a PowerShell Module for interfacing with the [Password Pusher](https://github.com/pglombardo/PasswordPusher) secure password / string sharing application, primarily through [pwpush.com](https://pwpush.com). It supports creating, retrieving, and deleting anonymous and authenticated pushes, links in any supported language, and getting Push and Dashboard data for authenticated users.

A primary design goal with this module was to provide **simple, beginner-friendly access** to API connections. Cmdlets provide clear responses to errors, support additional messaging via `-Debug` and `-Verbose`, transaction testing via `-Whatif` and `-Confirm`, and in general try to be as "Powershell-y" as possible.

Using *PassPushPosh* can be as simple as:

```powershell
PS> "Here's my secret!" | New-Push | select Link
Link
----
https://pwpush.com/en/p/gzv65wiiuciy
```

Or more completely...

```powershell
PS> Import-Module PassPushPosh
PS> $myPush = New-Push "Here's my secret!"
PS> $myPush.Link
https://pwpush.com/en/p/gzv65wiiuciy
```

See **[Docs](Docs)** or `Get-Help [command]` for more information. Happy sharing!
