# PassPushPosh Module

## Description

*PassPushPosh* is a PowerShell Module for interfacing with the Password Pusher website/application API.
It supports anonymous and authenticated pushes, provides verbose responses to errors, -Whatif and -Confirm,
and in general tries to be as "Powershell-y" as possible.

Using *PassPushPosh* can be as simple as:

```powershell
PS> Import-Module PassPushPosh
PS> $myPush = New-Push "Here's my secret!"
PS> $myPush.Link
